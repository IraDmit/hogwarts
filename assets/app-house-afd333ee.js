    Gryffindor House is one of the four houses at Hogwart into which the students are Sorted
    when they start their first year. Gryffindor is the Hogwarts house of founder Godric
    Gryffindor. Gryffindor House places high value on traits such as courage, chivalry, and
    nerve. During Harry’s time at Hogwarts, the head of Gryffindor House was Minerva McGonagall.

    <b>Blazon:</b> gules, a lion rampant or (that is, a golden lion on a red field, hence the
    Gryffindor colours of scarlet and gold)
  </p>
  <p><b>House Ghost:</b> Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington ("Nearly Headless Nick")</p>
  <p><b>Location:</b> Gryffindor Tower, entrance on the seventh floor</p>

  <p>
    The entrance to the Gryffindor common room (which, in turn, lead to the Gryffindor
    dormitories) is located behind a large painting of a Fat Lady in a pink silk dress. If you
    know the right password to tell her, she swings open to reveal a round opening in the wall.
    The common room contains a lot of squashy armchairs, a fireplace, and tables. The fireplace
    is connected to the Floo Network, but as it is extremely public except in the dead of night,
    Gryffindors usually use owls to communicate with their families instead. There's also a
    notice board, for public announcements such as the date of the next Hogsmeade weekend, but
    also for notices from individual students seeking to buy or sell secondhand books, or trade
    Chocolate Frog cards, or similar, as in any school.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two staircases opening off the common room into the Tower itself: the boys'
    staircase, on which the seven boys' dormitories are located (one for each year) and the
    girls' staircase, on which the seven girls' dormitories are located (one for each year). The
    girls' staircase is under a spell so that if a boy sets foot on it and persists for a few
    steps, a wailing klaxon goes off and the staircase temporarily Transfigures itself into a
    stone slide, sending him and anyone else on the stairs sailing to the bottom. According to
    Hogwarts: A History, the founders believed that girls were more trustworthy than boys, so
    that while the girls' staircase is enchanted to prevent boys from getting in, the boys'
    staircase does not carry a reciprocal enchantment . Each dormitory is a round room with
    windows looking out onto the grounds, and containing four-poster beds.

    The Gryffindor team won the Quidditch Cup during the 1993 - 1994 season - the first time
    since 1984 - and again during the 1995 - 1996 season. They wear robes of scarlet.

    Ravenclaw House is one of the four houses at Hogwart into which the students are Sorted when
    they start their first year. Ravenclaw is the Hogwarts house of founder Rowena Ravenclaw.
    The House places high value on intelligence, wit, and learning. During Harry’s time at
    Hogwarts, the head of Ravenclaw House was Filius Flitwick.

    Ravenclaw colours of blue and bronze)
  </p>
  <p><b>House Ghost:</b> Helena Ravenclaw, the Grey Lady</p>
  <p>
    <b>Location:</b> Ravenclaw Tower, which is located on the west side of the castle; the
    entrance is a door at the top of a tightly winding spiral staircase that leads up from the
    fifth floor. The door has neither handle nor keyhole, but a talking bronze knocker in the
    shape of an eagle. Rather than asking for a conventional password, the knocker will ask a
    question; if answered correctly, the knocker will compliment the person on the answer and
    the door will swing open
  </p>
  <p>
    The common room, like the other House common rooms, is decorated in House colours (blue and
    bronze silk wall hangings, in this case, and a midnight-blue carpet decorated with stars).
    The room is wide, circular, and very airy, with a domed ceiling painted with stars, and
    walls with graceful arched windows that provide a spectacular view of the surrounding
    mountains. There are bookcases, tables, and chairs, and opposite the entrance is another
    door leading to the dormitories. Beside this door is a plinth on which stands a life-size
    statue in white marble of Rowena Ravenclaw wearing her diadem.

    Slytherin House is one of the four houses into which students are Sorted when they start
    their first year at Hogwarts. Slytherin House was founded by Salazar Slytherin around 990AD.
    His personal belief in the superiority of Pure Blood wizards still influences the attitudes
    of Slytherin members today.

    <b>Blazon:</b> vert, a serpent argent (that is, a silver serpent on a green field, hence the
    Slytherin colours of green and silver). The serpent device signifies the founder’s gift of
    being a Parselmouth.

  <p><b>House Ghost:</b> The Bloody Baron</p>
  <p>
    <b>Location:</b> The Slytherin common room is a low-ceilinged, dungeon-like room with
    greenish lamps and chairs, with skulls all around. It is located under the lake, and has
    tapestries decorated with scenes from the lives of famous Slytherins. According to the
    Slytherin House Introduction Letter, the beds in the dormitories are four-posters with green
    silk hangings and covers embroidered with silver threads. You can hear the soothing sound of
    the lake lapping against the windows at night

    Hufflepuff House is the Hogwarts house of founder Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff House values
    character traits such as dedication, fair play, and hard work. Hufflepuffs are often
    unjustly characterized as unintelligent or as losers not good enough for any of the other
    houses.

  <p><b>Head:</b> Professor Pomona Sprout</p>
  <p><b>Founder: </b> Helga Hufflepuff</p>

  <p>
    <b>Blazon:</b> A badger sable (that is, a black badger on a golden field, hence the
    Hufflepuff colours of yellow and black)
  </p>
  <p><b>House Ghost:</b> The Fat Friar</p>

  <p>
    The Hufflepuff Common Room is accessed through a pile of barrels that is in a recess a
    little past the still life painting that is the entrance to the kitchens (Pm); to reach it,
    you enter a door to the right of the main staircase in the Entrance Hall and down a
    staircase there.Although it is therefore at dungeon level, it is “as dissimilar as possible”
    from the Potions classroom. The common room is decorated in House colours, which in this
    case means that there are lots of yellow hangings; like Gryffindor Tower, it has a lot of
    comfortable armchairs. There are “little underground tunnels leading to the dormitories, all
    of which have perfectly round doors, like barrel tops”.One gains entry to the Hufflepuff
    common room by tapping out the rhythm to the name “Helga Hufflepuff” on a stack of barrels.
    Tapping incorrectly or on the wrong barrel will cause one of the barrels to spill vinegar
    all over the person trying to enter (Pm: Hufflepuff).
